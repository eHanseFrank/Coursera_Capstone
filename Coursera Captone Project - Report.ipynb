Futher Data Cleaning\n5. Modeling\n6. Training\n7. Testing and Evaluation\n8. (Choose different model settings or complete different model and start off from step 5)\n9. Testing and Evaluation\n10. Conclusion\n\n\nHowever, since data available and relevant data is gathered in just one source/table, we can skip the Data Engineering part i.e. the first step.\nSo my project will abide by the following procedure:\n1. Data Cleaning\n2. Data Exploration\n3. (Futher Data Cleaning)\n4. Modeling\n5. Training\n6. Testing and Evaluation\n7. (Choose different model settings or complete different model and start off from step 5)\n8. Testing and Evaluation\n9. Conclusion"

I will split the data into 'modeling-data'\nand 'evaluation-data'. The former is the portion to be used for training and testing the model and the latter\nwill be used to evaluate the optimized model established.\nFor evaluation I will calculate the Jaccard index and F1-score."
